# VIM INTRO

## My fealings about vim

- First fealing?! ... like I want to hit someone -.- (specially with mouse)!
- Real programmers should use vim! vi! nano! willpower to >> | << bits!
- I dont want gui, just console, otherwise why to bother when I can use VS, JetBrains with vim mode?
- Maybe not helpful to pick girls -.- ...
- Great for showing off among programmers! I use vim, Ha! I, your granddaddy is awesome! 


# VIM DISTROS

## yavide:
- for c++ dev
- not good for nvim

## spf13-vim:
- cross platform
- allin
- but not good for nvim

## evervim:
- problem in completion on wsl
- great user friendly
- half step in nvim
- 1998 chinese sophomore

## navim:
- based on evervim
- from here I know than .vim config are actually in Python (now its easier)

## rafi/vim-config
- not so userfriendly
- just forkit and do as you please
- problem with rendering of built in theme:
-- trash its theme config file content and put onedark, dracula, etc...

# My REQUIREMENTS FROM VIM DISTRO

## must be:
- nvim (made by Shougo)
- only terminal
- not light, not dark side, grey (dark is ide, light is terminal apps)
- use Shougo favourite plugins that match nvim perfectly:
-- [why?](http://howivim.com/2016/shougo/)
-- dein
-- denim
-- vimproc.vim
-- denite/unite.vim
-- deoplete.nvim/neocomplete.vim (we do not need YCM when nvim is async opposite to vim)
-- vimshell.vim
-- vimfiler.vim

## optional:
- easy to do user config or fork and reconfig




# VIM CONFIG

## My plugins

### For conda envs:

cjrh/vim-conda

#### example of usage

```vim

#in vim
:CondaChangeEnv<ENTER>

#in ~/.config/nvim/init.vim
map <F4> :CondaChangeEnv<CR>
```
